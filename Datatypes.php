<!-- PHP Data types used to know size and type of stored value of variables
php is loosely typed language so no need to declared which type data type to variables

1) scalar
=>integer
=>float/double
=>string
=>boolean 
2) compound
=>arrays
=> objects

3) special type
=> null===> if we not declare value of var then it store null value it is a data type
=> resource type => db connection
